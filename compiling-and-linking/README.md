# Compiling and linking

Objective is gathering processes (as in things to do) regarding building c programs. That is: compiling executables and object files, implicite and explicite linking, linking external libraries, possibly publishing a code as library, Makefiles. Also fiddling around with gcc vs. clang or other toolchains.

## Standalone executive

- from single .c-file (`gcc`)

## Example with dependencies

- from multiple c-files
- explicite linking (`gcc`, possibly `ld` if not too complicated)
